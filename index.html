        <p><b>Registration for the Spring 2013 Commencement Ceremony begins February 1, 2013 and will be open through April 12, 2013.</b></p>
        <p>Any student who has completed the 160 units required, and who has not already participated in a past undergraduate commencement ceremony, is eligible and welcome to participate in the Spring 2013 Commencement ceremony.</p>
        <p>Any student who expects to receive a degree in September or December is encouraged to participate in the Fall 2013 commencement which is held closer to the completion of your studies. Typically the Fall is a smaller ceremony and allows for students to invite more guests. The FALL CEREMONY will be on Saturday, December 14th 2013.</p>
